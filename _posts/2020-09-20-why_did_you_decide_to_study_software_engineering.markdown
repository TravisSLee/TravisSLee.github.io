Well 2020 has been an odd year. The pandemic forced me to quit my job at the bank, so I thought why not try pick up programming again. I had some experience with Stata and Mathematica during my undergraduate days at UB(University at Buffalo), and enjoyed the challenge. Programming is like building legos as a kid. The programming language is like the box full of pieces and with instruction you get the finished masterpiece. I want to actively apply my education into  my design, my work. Without this career change, I feel like I would be stuck with working retail jobs eventhough I hold a Bachaelor's Degree in Economics. This program will certainly make a difference in my life
