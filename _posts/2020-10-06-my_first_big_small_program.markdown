This project was a big challenge. I only have to thank my instructor, Nancy, and lots of coffee and espresso shots for getting me through this first project. It's has been a very long a week and half between this project and moving into another apartment in the heart of Buffalo. 

My only regret on this project was not using "binding.pry" command for the initial first half of my project.  This command solved the issue I have been working on for hours in 10 minutes. Thanks to Nancy and her knowedge she finally helped me figure out how to use binding.pry and come up with the framework with my project. Thanks for reading my blog!!
