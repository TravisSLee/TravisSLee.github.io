I have to say this project was really fun to program.  The not so fun part of it was trying hours upon hours of unsuccessfully trying to get git commands to work. Finally, I got the issued resolved by making an SHH key. The best part of it all was breaking out of the sign in and login loop. It's really great to see great to see that I can login and create objects now.
